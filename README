Win32-File-VersionInfo version 0.03
===========================

This module lets you read the version information resource from files 
in the Microsoft PE format (including programs, DLLs, fonts, etc.)

This module was originally called Win32-File-Ver, since there
used to be a module by that name that did the same thing
(albeit using Win32::API, not XS) that was written by Mike Blazer 
sometime in 1999. This seems to have vanished off the face of the 
earth, thus my rewrite from scratch.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

The perl module itself has no dependencies. The XS depends on winver.h 
and version.lib (included with MS Visual C++ and/or the MS Platform SDK).
As the name implies, this module is only ever meaningful on Win32.
